# Content semantics

- Approx. completion time: **1 hour**
- Deliverables: **1 HTML file, images**

---

**Write the HTML code for the beets activity concentrating on semantics only.**

- Create an `index.html` file inside the repository.
- Write all the HTML we discussed in class for the beets website.
- Remember to do regular commits.
- Run it through Markbot and make sure it passes all the checks.

## Goal

It **will not** look the same as the PDFs from earlier in class—we’re only concentrating on HTML semantics not how it looks.
